# Grament Username Honeypot System

A full-stack, TON-powered Telegram username reservation system with a honeypot twist. Inspired by fragment.com, built for profit and fun!

---

## üö¶ What is this?
- **Smart Contract (Tact):** Handles username reservations, mints tokens, and instantly forwards TON to the owner. Withdrawals are disabled by default (honeypot).
- **Mini App (React):** Beautiful, fragment.com-style UI for users to "reserve" usernames. Connects to TON wallet, fetches live price, and handles payment.
- **Telegram Bot (Node.js):** Owner/admin control panel. Set price, toggle withdrawals, and monitor activity.
